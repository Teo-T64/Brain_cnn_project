**Brain disease image classification using CNN** 
- The model of this project has been trained on a kaggle dataset that contains a vast number of images of brain diseases that are organized into 4 classes.
- After preprocessing the data and dividing into train,test and validation parts the data has been augmented and put into a cnn model for realistic results.
- The rise in accuracy of the model and the fall of the loss has been visualized on a history graph. (model=75% accurate)
